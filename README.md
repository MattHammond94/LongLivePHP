### General details

* General purpose scripting language

* Runs serverside but geared towards web development.

* Interpreted and does not need to be compiled. 

* Often used in correlation with relational databases.

* Commonly used in the LAMP stack - (Linux(os), Apache(Web server software), Mysql(DB) and PHP BABY!)

* Linux is used for hosting and is not neccessarilly required if you want to host elsewhere.

* For developing locally can use XAMPP (X(cross platform), Apache, mySQL, PHP and Pearl(Another programming language)) - XAMPP needs to be installed for appropriate OS.

### Running PHP/Setup:

After installing XAMPP use the desktop application to run your local server. Files are served to localhost from the htdocs file in the XAMPP application folder.

You can add files and folders from here to be viewed in the browser: adding a dir "home" with an index file "home.php" will allow you to go to localhost/home where the home.php file will be rendered.

adding further files to home dir can be accessed at /home/<FileName>
